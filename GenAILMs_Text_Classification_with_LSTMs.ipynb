The input to the model is a sequence of word indices, each representing a word in the vocabulary. Because we set maxlen = 200, each input sequence contains exactly 200 words. Therefore, for each input example, the output of the embedding layer is a matrix of shape (200, 128), where 200 is the number of words and 128 is the dimensionality of each embedding. The first dimension, None, indicates that the batch size can vary during training or inference.\n",

Each LSTM has 64 units, and the outputs from both directions are concatenated, resulting in 128 features per time step. Since return_sequences=True is set, the layer returns the full output sequence for each time step in the input. The shape (None, 200, 128) thus indicates that for each of the 200 time steps, the layer outputs a 128-dimensional vector, preserving the sequential structure of the input.\n",

However, this time return_sequences=False (which is the default), so the layer does not return the full sequence of outputs. Instead, it returns only the final hidden state after processing the entire input sequence. The outputs from the forward and backward LSTMs are concatenated to form a single 128-dimensional vector. As a result, the shape (None, 128) means that each input sequence is now represented by a single fixed-size vector summarizing the information extracted by both LSTMs."
