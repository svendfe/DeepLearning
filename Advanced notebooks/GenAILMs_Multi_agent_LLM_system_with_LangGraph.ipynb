        "*  *Tool Use*: Agents that can use external tools (in this case, an internet search engine) to gather information.\n",
        "*  *Reflection & Self-Correction*: A cyclical reasoning process in which an agent (or multiple agents) critically evaluates its own outputs (or those of another agent), identifies flaws or areas for improvement, and iteratively refines the response until a desired quality threshold is met.\n",
        "*  *Multi-Agent Collaboration*: Multiple specialized agents (Planner, Searcher, Summarizer, Writer, Critique) that work together, passing information along a defined workflow.\n",

        "## Some design decisions\n",
        "**About THIS planner agent**:  it is intentionally restricted to generating only a list of search queries, based on preliminary information gathered via a first web search. This design choice supports two goals: (1) ensuring modularity by giving the planner a narrow, well-defined role, and (2) enabling it to handle unknown or niche topics—especially useful when using LLMs without internet access or limited domain knowledge (e.g., asking LLaMA about \"DeepSeek\"). Generic research plans like “gather information, analyze, synthesize” are avoided because later agents in the system are already dedicated to those tasks. Instead, the planner focuses solely on formulating precise, actionable search queries to bootstrap the agentic pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "**About THIS summarizer agent**:  uses a refine strategy to incrementally build a comprehensive summary from a list of retrieved documents. Instead of concatenating all documents at once—which could easily exceed the LLM’s context window—it processes each document sequentially, updating the summary step-by-step. This approach is particularly useful for long or numerous inputs, making the agent scalable and memory-efficient. While we implement the refinement loop manually here for clarity, LangChain provides built-in summarization chains that encapsulate this logic and streamline the process further.\n",
