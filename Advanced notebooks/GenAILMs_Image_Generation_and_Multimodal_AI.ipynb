        "4. **Calculate Loss**: You compare the noise predicted by the model with the actual noise you added. The difference is the loss.\n",

This involves continuing the training process on a small, specialized dataset (e.g., 15-20 images of the new object/style) for a much shorter time. This adjusts the model's weights to become an expert in your specific concept."

CLIP, developed by OpenAI in 2021, popularized the use of **Contrastive Learning** to align visual and textual representations:\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Train on the Task**: You feed the model an `(image, question)` pair and train it to output the correct `answer`. The loss is calculated based on how far the model's prediction is from the ground-truth answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Update Weights**: The error is backpropagated, but you might only update the weights of the new \"head\", or you might \"unfreeze\" the whole model and let all the weights be updated slightly. This second approach is full fine-tuning.\n",

        "The breakthrough of generalist models is that they teach a Large Language Model—an expert in text, grammar, and reasoning—a new skill: how to read images. The architecture to achieve this generally involves two main components connected by a \"bridge.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The Vision Encoder**: This is the \"eye\" of the system. Its only job is to look at an image and convert its pixels into a meaningful numerical format (embeddings).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The Large Language Model (LLM)**: This is the \"brain.\" It's the same kind of powerful language model you're already familiar with (like GPT-3, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, etc.). It receives the numerical representation of the image and the user's text prompt to perform reasoning and generate a textual response.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general data flow looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "Image → Vision Encoder → Sequence of Image Embeddings → Adapter/Bridge → LLM Input + Text Prompt Input → LLM → Text Output\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, multimodal LLMs  treat images as just another part of the input language. Imagine the input to an LLM: `[token1, token2, token3, ...]`  For a multimodal LLM, the input becomes: `[img_tok1, img_tok2, ..., img_tok_N,  text_tok1, text_tok2, ...]` The model's reasoning and generation capabilities, which you are familiar with from text-only LLMs, can now be applied to the concepts and objects present in the image tokens. This is what allows for the incredible flexibility we see in multimodal models such as ChatGPT and Gemini.\n",

        "## The Key: How \"Image Tokens\" are Created\n",
        "\n",
        "The term \"image token\" is a useful abstraction. In reality, the model creates a sequence of embeddings (vectors) that are dimensionally compatible with the LLM's text embeddings. This is done through a process, usually involving a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** (see Part 2).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the step-by-step process of creating Image Tokens:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Step 1: **Image Patching**. The Vision Encoder doesn't look at the whole image at once. Instead, it slices the image into a grid of smaller, fixed-size squares called patches. Think of it like cutting a photograph into a mosaic of puzzle pieces. This allows the model to process the image as a sequence, similar to how it processes a sequence of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Step 2: **Embedding the Patches**. Each patch is then \"embedded.\" It's fed through a neural network that converts the raw pixels of that small square into a numerical vector, or an embedding. This vector represents the visual content of that specific patch in a high-dimensional space. At this stage, you have a sequence of vectors, one for each piece of the original image.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Step 3: The **Projection Layer** (The \"Bridge\").  This is the most critical step for making the two systems compatible. The embeddings produced by the Vision Encoder are in a \"visual space,\" which the LLM doesn't understand. The LLM understands a \"language space.\"  A small, trainable neural network, often called a projection layer or an adapter, acts as a translator. Its sole purpose is to take the sequence of image patch embeddings and convert them into a sequence of embeddings that live in the exact same dimensional space as the LLM's word embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "After this step, the image has been transformed into a sequence of vectors that the LLM can read and process just as if they were embeddings from a sentence. The LLM can now apply its attention mechanisms across both the text tokens from the prompt and these new \"image tokens.\"\n",

A famous example is the LAION dataset, which contains billions of image-alt-text pairs scraped from the web. In this stage, the model's goal is to align the two modalities. It learns that the visual information from an image of a dog (processed by the Vision Encoder) should correspond to the semantic meaning of the words \"a photo of a dog\" (processed by the text embedder).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Instruction Fine-Tuning (Learning to Obey). After pre-training, the model knows what's in an image, but it isn't yet a helpful assistant. The second stage uses curated, high-quality datasets of (image, instruction, desired_output) triplets. This teaches the model to follow commands. For example:\n",
