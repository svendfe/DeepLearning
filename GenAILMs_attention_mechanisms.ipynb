        "\n",
        "Before jumping into the code, let’s unpack the core idea. An **attention mechanism** lets a model decide *which* parts of the input are most relevant for the task at hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of translating the sentence:  \n",
        "> *The black cat sat on the mat.*  \n",
        "\n",
        "When you’re about to write the Spanish word **\"gato\"**, your brain naturally zeroes in on the English word **\"cat\"**, filtering out less relevant words.\n",
        "\n",
        "In neural networks, this selective focus is implemented by creating three vectors for each input token:  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Query (Q)** – Captures what the current token is looking for in context: *“What information do I need?”*  \n",
        "- **Key (K)** – Encodes what information the token offers: *“Here’s what I represent.”*  \n",
        "- **Value (V)** – Contains the actual detailed content or meaning of the token, which will be *retrieved and passed along* when a Key matches a Query.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process works like this:  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Scoring relevance** – Compare the Query of the current token with the Key of every token using a dot product.  \n",
        "2. **Scaling and normalizing** – Divide by the square root of the Key’s dimension \\\\( \\sqrt{d_k} \\\\) to avoid overly large values, then apply a softmax to turn scores into probabilities.  \n",
        "3. **Building context** – Multiply each Value vector by its corresponding attention weight and sum the results, producing a **context-enriched representation**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The whole operation is expressed as:  \n",
        "\n",
        "\\\\[\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax} \\left( \\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\right) V\\\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "This formula is the mathematical heart of the attention mechanism — it’s how each token “looks at” every other token and gathers the context it needs."

        "* **Input:** `\"translate English to Spanish: A black cat sat on the mat.\"`  \n",
        "The prefix `translate English to Spanish:` tells the model to perform a translation task from English to Spanish. Without the task prefix, T5 might not realize it needs to translate and could produce unrelated output, since it was trained on many different tasks.\n",

        " How Cross-Attention Works\n",
        "1. **Encoding the source:**  \n",
        "   The encoder processes the entire input sequence (e.g., an English sentence) using self-attention, producing a rich contextual representation for each token.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Decoding with context:**  \n",
        "   The decoder generates the output sequence (e.g., a Spanish sentence) one token at a time.  \n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Bridging the two with cross-attention:**  \n",
        "   At every decoding step, cross-attention allows the decoder to attend to the encoder’s outputs.  \n",
        "   - The *queries* come from the decoder’s current hidden state.  \n",
        "   - The *keys* and *values* come from the encoder’s final representations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Example:**  \n",
        "   When generating the word *gato*, the decoder’s cross-attention heads can focus strongly on the encoder token *\"cat\"*, ensuring semantic alignment between source and target.  \n",

        "\n",
        "With model_view, BertViz displays the attention matrices for each layer and each head. It is usually most informative to inspect the last layer (starting with the leftmost heads), since these capture higher-level semantic relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interface also provides a dropdown menu to select which type of attention to display: encoder self-attention, decoder self-attention, or cross-attention. In our case, we are mainly interested in cross-attention, since it shows how the decoder attends to the encoder’s representations when generating the output sequence.\n",
        "\n",

This happens because the model uses the task prefix `\"translate English to Spanish:\"` as an important signal to guide the translation. As a result, the decoder pays extra attention to these prefix tokens since they define the target language and task, sometimes more than to the actual source words like \"cat\". This is expected behavior and reflects how T5 leverages the prefix to control output generation."
