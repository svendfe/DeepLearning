        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we’ll explore how to build fast and modular Generative AI applications using LangChain and Groq.\n",
        "\n",
        "[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a flexible framework designed to help developers integrate large language models (LLMs) into real-world applications. It provides tools for chaining together components like prompt templates, memory, agents, and access to external tools or data—making it ideal for building intelligent, composable workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Groq](https://groq.com/) offers an inference API optimized for ultra-low latency and high-throughput LLM execution. It enables real-time performance with state-of-the-art models such as LLaMA 3 and Gemma, making it an excellent option when responsiveness is critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "⚠️ While we use Groq here for convenience and speed, LangChain is model-agnostic. You can easily swap Groq for other backends like OpenAI, Hugging Face, or Anthropic. You can also run open-source models locally on your own machine using tools like LM Studio, Ollama, or Text Generation WebUI—ideal for development without API limits or cloud dependency.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining LangChain’s modularity with a fast inference backend like Groq (or a local setup), you’ll learn how to prototype and deploy efficient, production-ready LLM-powered solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning Objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Connect and use the Groq API via LangChain to run Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The `system role` is traditionally used to establish rules, instructions, or a “code of conduct” that the model must follow throughout the entire conversation. It acts as an “invisible voice” defining the AI assistant’s overall behavior, tone, boundaries, and internal guidelines before the user interacts. For example, you might instruct the model: “You are a medical assistant and never give legal diagnoses.” This role is essential to control the model’s behavior across different tasks — whether as a polite assistant, a strict data validator, or a customer support agent. Defining the system role helps produce more predictable and consistent outputs, which is crucial when integrating LLMs into production-level applications.\n",
        "\n",

        "Let’s revisit the same problem: classifying a customer review. We'll now separate the prompt into system and user roles. Additionally, the input data (review text) will appear in the user prompt using a placeholder that will be instantiated when the chain is invoked. A \"chain\" (of LangChain) is a single object that, when called, automatically fills the prompt with the input data, sends it to the model, and returns the output.\n",
